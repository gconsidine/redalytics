Redalytics

Redalytics is a tool that allows a user to examine a reddit account's post
history conveniently.  All user data is scraped, then handed off to the 
client asynchronously one page of post history at a time.  No information is
stored about the reddit account being analyzed or the user visiting Redalytics.
Once the user closes the Redalytics tab/window, all information for the 
given account will be gone.
